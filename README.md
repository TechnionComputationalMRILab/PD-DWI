# PD-DWI

PD-DWI is a physiologically-decomposed Diffusion-Weighted MRI machine-learning model for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive breast cancer.

PD-DWI was developed by [TCML](https://tcml-bme.github.io/) group as part of [BMMR2 challenge](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=89096426) using [ACRIN-6698](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=50135447) dataset.

This work was accepted to MICCAI 2022 (to be held during Sept 18-22 in Singapore).
